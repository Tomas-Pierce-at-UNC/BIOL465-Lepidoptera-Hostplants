# Use this R script file to document how you proceed from 
# your raw data files to your processed (e.g. aggregated and/or merged) 
# data to analyses and plots. Use comments to create a road map for 
# everything that you will need to do. Some general steps that might 
# be useful are below, but it is only a guide and your own set of 
# steps required may be different.

# Be as specific as possible with respect to which fields are being 
# manipulated and what exactly is being calculated when writing your comments.



### 0. Load any libraries you might need, e.g. dplyr, vioplot, raster
#   You do NOT need to specify install.packages(), just library()




### 1. Read in raw data files
#   Mention briefly the source of these data files (e.g. provide link)
#   and what kind of data each file contains in comments



### 2. Dataset exploration
#   Make sure you understand the dataset. Try making histograms or boxplots of your data.
#   Use summary() on your data objects to quickly see what formats each column are in.



### 3. Simplify data (subset to the columns and/or rows of interest)



### 4. Calculate metrics of interest (e.g. mean abundance per species, or 
#   species richness per site, etc.)



### 5. Combine relevant information from each of your two or more datasets
#   using left_join() (or full_join or inner_join)



### 6. Conduct analyses (linear regression, variance partitioning, etc)



### 7. Make plots

# One basic test of your code is whether you can open a new RStudio window, and #
# remove all existing objects with the 'broom' in the top right, and then run   #
# the whole script without getting an error.                                    #
